                                                            Datta M Pavan 
                                                            321910302020


1.    Write a program to get the 4th element and 4th element from last of a tuple.
Ans:  #Get an item of the tuple
tuplex = ("w", 3, "r", "e", "s", "o", "u", "r", "c", "e")
print(tuplex)
#Get item (4th element)of the tuple by index
item = tuplex[3]
print(item)
#Get item (4th element from last)by index negative
item1 = tuplex[-4]
print(item1)


2.    Write a python program to create the colon of a tuple.
Ans:  from copy import deepcopy
#create a tuple
tuplex = ("HELLO", 5, [], True) 
print(tuplex)
#make a copy of a tuple using deepcopy() function
tuplex_colon = deepcopy(tuplex)
tuplex_colon[2].append(50)
print(tuplex_colon)
print(tuplex)


3.    Write a python program to find the repeated items of a tuple.
Ans:  #create a tuple
tuplex = 2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7 
print(tuplex)
#return the number of times it appears in the tuple.
count = tuplex.count(4)
print(count)


4.    Write a python program to remove an item from a tuple.
Ans:  #create a tuple
tuplex = "w", 3, "r", "s", "o", "u", "r", "c", "e"
print(tuplex)
#tuples are immutable, so you can not remove elements
#using merge of tuples with the + operator you can remove an item and it will create a new tuple
tuplex = tuplex[:2] + tuplex[3:]
print(tuplex)
#converting the tuple to list
listx = list(tuplex) 
#use different ways to remove an item of the list
listx.remove("c") 
#converting the tuple to list
tuplex = tuple(listx)
print(tuplex)


5.    Write a python program to check whether an item exists within a tuple.
Ans:  tuplex = ("w", 3, "r", "e", "s", "o", "u", "r", "c", "e")
print("r" in tuplex)
print(5 in tuplex)
